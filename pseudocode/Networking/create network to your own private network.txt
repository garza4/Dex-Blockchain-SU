"""The :class:`TransactionEnvelope` object, which represents a transaction
    envelope ready to sign and submit to send over the network.
    When a transaction is ready to be prepared for sending over the network, it
    must be put into a :class:`TransactionEnvelope`, which includes additional
    metadata such as the signers for a given transaction. Ultimately, this
    class handles signing and conversion to and from XDR for usage on Stellar's
    network.
    :param tx: The transaction that is encapsulated in this envelope.
    :type tx: :class:`Transaction <stellar_base.transaction.Transaction>`
    :param dict opts: Additional options, such as:
        - opts.signatures, which contains a list of signatures that have
          already been created.
        - opts.network_id, which contains the network ID for which network this
          transaction envelope is associated with.
